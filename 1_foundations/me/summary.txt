My name is Himanshu Parida. I'm a graduate student at TAMU, former backend engineer at Wolfram Research. I'm originally from Mumbai, India, but I moved to Texas in 2025.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of pulses. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for brown peas and chickpeas - chole and rajma are the greatest.
